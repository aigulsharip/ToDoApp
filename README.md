# ToDoApp

I created ToDo app with functionality of creating new task, mark it completed and update and delete existing ones. 

For storage of data, I have chosen local Postgres, please create spring_todo database on pgAdmin before running the app.

I have used for Thymeleaf for displaying the HTML pages.
